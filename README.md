### Core Android

#### Base
* **Tell all the Android application components.**
    - App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app. Some components depend on others.
    - There are four different types of app components:
        - Activities(#activity)
        - Services(#services)
        - Broadcast receivers(#broadcast_receiver)
        - Content providers(#content_provider)

* **What is the project structure of an Android Application?**
* <p align="center">
    <text>manifests
Contains the AndroidManifest.xml file.
java
Contains the Java source code files, separated by package names, including JUnit test code.
res
Contains all non-code resources, such as XML layouts, UI strings, and bitmap images, divided into corresponding sub-directories</text>

* **What is `Application` class?**
    - The Application class in Android is the base class within an Android app that contains all other components such as activities and services. The Application class, or any subclass of the Application class, is instantiated before any other class when the process for your application/package is created.

#### Activity and Fragment
* **What is onSavedInstanceState() and onRestoreInstanceState() in activity?**
    - onSavedInstanceState() - This method is used to store data before pausing the activity.
    - onRestoreInstanceState() - This method is used to recover the saved state of an activity when the activity is recreated after destruction. So, the onRestoreInstanceState() receive the bundle that contains the instance state information.

* **When should you use a Fragment rather than an Activity?**
    - When you have some UI components to be used across various activities
    - When multiple view can be displayed side by side just like viewPager

* **What is the difference between FragmentPagerAdapter vs FragmentStatePagerAdapter?**
    - FragmentPagerAdapter: Each fragment visited by the user will be stored in the memory but the view will be destroyed. When the page is revisited, then the view will be created not the instance of the fragment.
    - FragmentStatePagerAdapter: Here, the fragment instance will be destroyed when it is not visible to the user, except the saved state of the fragment.

* **What is the difference between adding/replacing fragment in backstack?**

#### View & ViewGroup
   - ConstraintLayout combines a simple, expressive and flexible layout system with the powerful features built into the Android Studio Designer tool.
   - It makes it easier to create responsive user interface layouts that adapt automatically to different screen sizes and changing device orientations.
   - This has the benefit of avoiding many problems inherent in nesting layouts. It allows designing so-called flat or shallow layout hierarchies. This leads to less complex layouts and improved user interface rendering performance at runtime.
